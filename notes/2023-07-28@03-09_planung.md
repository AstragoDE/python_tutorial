## Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types
- Understanding variables and their importance
- Basic data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Variable assignment and reassignment
- Exercise: Create variables to store the name, age, and favorite color of a person.

## Lesson 3: Basic Input and Output
- Using input() to receive user input
- Formatting output using f-strings
- String concatenation and conversion
- Exercise: Build a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Lesson 4: Conditional Statements
- Introducing if, elif, and else statements
- Comparison operators and logical operators
- Nested if statements
- Exercise: Write a program to check if a given number is even or odd.

## Lesson 5: Loops in Python
- Introduction to for loops and while loops
- Loop control statements: break and continue
- Iterating over lists and strings
- Exercise: Create a program to print all the numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.

## Lesson 6: Lists and Tuples
- Understanding lists and their common operations
- Indexing and slicing in lists
- Immutable lists with tuples
- Exercise: Reverse the elements of a given list without using any built-in functions.

## Lesson 7: Dictionaries and Sets
- Working with dictionaries: keys, values, and items
- Sets and their unique property
- Dictionary comprehension and set operations
- Exercise: Create a dictionary of names and ages, then find the oldest person.

## Lesson 8: Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Function arguments and return values
- Local vs. global scope
- Exercise: Write a function to check if a given number is prime or not.

## Lesson 9: File Handling
- Opening and reading files in Python
- Writing and appending to files
- Handling exceptions with try-except blocks
- Exercise: Read a text file and count the occurrences of each word.

## Lesson 10: Introduction to Modules and Libraries
- Importing modules and using built-in functions
- Exploring popular Python libraries (e.g., math, random)
- Creating and using custom modules
- Exercise: Generate a random password using the `random` library.

## Lesson 11: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
- Introduction to classes and objects
- Defining attributes and methods
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Exercise: Create a simple class to model a basic car.

## Lesson 12: Conclusion and Next Steps
- Recap of the concepts learned throughout the lessons
- Suggest resources and projects for further practice
- Encourage exploration of more advanced Python topics (web development, data science, etc.)

Remember to adapt the pace and complexity of the lessons based on the group's progress and learning style. Encourage them to practice regularly, work on coding exercises, and build small projects to solidify their understanding of Python programming. Happy teaching!
